[DESIGN]
- spawn player back to save position
- it is a spell which is free but takes five seconds to perform
- actually ignore that
- it is not a good idea
- therefore I retract that statement
- as if it never were spoken
- as if it never were spoken
- as if it never were spoken
- that is a nice sentence
- a kind of poem
- a very concise kind
- no longer than a sentence
- elegant and bearing wisdom
- elegant and bearing wisdom
- elegant and bearing wisdom
- in it hidden
- a clever contradiction
- a treasure
- each item powers up
- and can be used at anytime
- however its effectiveness is proportional to fullness
- i imagined a lightning bolt spell
- in which a circle abouts around the mouse
- the circle represents the radius of the lightning bolt spell
- it takes a moment to caste
- then a giant a giant cloud appears in the sky
- it produces a momentous bolt of lightning which shoots down at the ground
- and fills that area with electric current
- introducing idea passive zap item
- one may wonder what is a passive zap item
- it randomly shoots a small zap of lightning at nearby enemies
- it does not produce really hard damage
- it is a relatively low damage early game item
- however relative to its cost
- it actually offers a lot of benefits
- introducing another new idea
- the early game is actually quite difficult
- one starts with very low level weapons
- one may choose the options are
- bow
- sword
- staff
- the bow endows the user with a simple skill
- critical hit
- the critical hit applies double damage
- the sword has health steal
- idea having the skeletons archers as a first encounter is way to difficult
- the first opponents need to be little orcs which get killed in one hit
- the second area the orcs take two hits to kill
- it also has orcs which only take take hit to kill
- these are what the player is after
- but higher level enemies reward higher reward
- the third area has the same as level two
- however with the addition of skeleton archers
- unlock additional amulet and weapon slots with level progression
- unlock weapon slots 1 5 10 20 40 80
- unlock amulet slots 3 7 15 20 30 60
- elements
    - earth is strong vs electricity and weak vs air
    - fire is strong vs air and weak vs water
    - water is strong vs fire and weak vs electricity
    - air is strong vs earth and weak vs fire
    - electricity is strong vs water and weak vs earth
      the ability index
- display as an entire ui
- the abilities are locked until you can find them on the map
- each boss that one kills earns the player an ability
- what i do like about that is it creates a kind of map
- a map for the user to explore
- it is the physical evidence of something there to be explored
    - a list of cons
        - lose a sense of mystery
    - to be honest i do not want to implement this after all
    - after righting it out and having a chance to ponder over it
    - i changed my mind
    - that means that i will not implement the map of abilities
    - the loot is random
    - the only argument of the loot is the level of the player and the value of the opponent
    - a spell can be charged and released
    - while a spell is being charged
        - another weapon may not be withdrawn
        - a spell charged to its full potential
        - a fully charged spell is much more effective
        - the sword recovers quite quickly
        - it consumes a certain amount each time it is used
        - if it does not have enough charge it cannot be invoked
        - start with three elements
        - upgrade to five after that
        - skip four
        - four is not compatible
        - with the gameplay
        - each character has a unique combination of elements
        - each character has a unique combination of
            - weapons
            - armours
            - spells
            - items
        - that would actually make a very good user interface
        - that is another skill enum
        - elements and those
        - it is just an idea
        - something worth thinking about
        - it does not mean it must be so
        - the question is what extra would they bring
        - that is not already covered by the four elements design
        - it complicates the system considerably
        - there is also already a lot of diversity around the combination
        - of weapons and armours
        - the elements are what dictate however effective anything is
        - for example health potion benefit from water and fire
        - five the inventory system
        - four tabs weapons armours spells and items
        - there is also the element page
        - getting the error inventory full just sucks
        - the item must be picked up
        - it is essentially pokemon
        - one kills rock monsters
        - orcs
        - dark elves
        - gruntlings
        - grunts
        - save grunts
        - ghost
        - spook
        - amulant
        - amulant.com
        - purchase
        - amulant is a name
        - it is also known as an amulet in the foreign tongue
        - it means artifact
        - artifacts can be collected
        - and equipped
        - artifacts provide bonuses to the player
        - such as being able to caste a certain spell
        - many cause passive improvements
        - such as more health
        - or damage
        - some provide bonus elements
        - for example five fire elements added  

- spell types
  - charges allow a spell to be used multiple times
  - attribute the higher a charge is the more damage it does
  - charge spell 
  - when selected a charge spell begins charging, 
    - it can be released any time
    - its effectiveness is determined by its charge percentage 
  - ultimate can only be used once it is fully charge and it gets fully depleted on use
