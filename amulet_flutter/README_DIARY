oddstruc abbreviated as ods is a data structure like

json or

xml or

md

the data supports several different data types

values

objects

lists

the example the blender structure at the top of this page demonstrates these concepts

a value is a value on the left and a value on the right





oddscript it is a text format that only supports lowercase letters of the alphabet

for example there are no commas or question marks are allow

the reason those are not allowed is because they are not letters of the alphabet

the only styling allowed is a newline

all lines are separate by one empty line
