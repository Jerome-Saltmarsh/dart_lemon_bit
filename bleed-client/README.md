# Design

The first time someone visits the site they are asked what region they would like to use
Once they select it doesn't directly connect
when the player selects a game to play it then connects to the server of that game using their region
This way each game has a dedicated server

Does the game type determine the ui layout
or the character type?

# Symbolic Hard Link
mklink /J common C:\Users\Jerome\github\bleed\bleed-common\lib

# IDEAS
- Captured Flags increase passive income
- The shooter mode disables the mouse and provides and aiming circle instead

# Goal
The goal is to platform which allows me to truly explore all of my creativity

# Games
Dota
Wow

#DESIGN
When a player kills a zombie,

the player earns money, experience and a random slot
Combinations of outcomes are used to craft items
Due to the luck element this determines the kind of build that the player will make, causing
each game to be completely unique and preventing the player from simply spamming a single strategy.

The slot machine aspect of it also causes the game to have an addictive quality to it.

When a zombie is killed, it drops a random slot.

Orbs
- Powder
- Gold
- Silver
- Bronze
- Ruby

When a player gains a level they can choose an attribute to improve
- Max Health
- Max Mana
- Magic Damage
- Physical Damage
