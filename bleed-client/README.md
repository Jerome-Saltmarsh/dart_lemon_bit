// IDEAS
// Captured Flags increase passive income

#Goal
The goal is to build something that people enjoy playing. If I can get a user base that plays consistently
then that is success for me.


# Architecture 



Network -> Parse -> Game State -> Render

Input -> Network

Game Loop -> Network Update

receive compiled game state from the network, parse it into game state then render.
